# Proton Mail Bridge docker

An always-up-to-date docker version of the [Proton mail Bridge](https://proton.me/mail/bridge) command line interface. It creates a local SMTP server, so other docker containers can send emails via your Proton email account.

__!WARNING!__ As of the time of this writing, you need a paid plan (Mail Plus, Proton Unlimited or Proton for Business) to be able to log in. It won't work with a free account.

## Install

Download the latest docker image from GitHub Container Registry:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/asyncura/proton-mail-bridge:latest  # Debian version (default)
```
Or from DockerHub:
```bash
docker pull asyncura/proton-mail-bridge:latest  # Debian version (default)
```

**(Alternative)** Or the lightweight version based on Alpine Linux from GitHub Container Registry:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/asyncura/proton-mail-bridge:alpine
```
Or from DockerHub:
```bash
docker pull asyncura/proton-mail-bridge:alpine
```
**(Optional)** It is recommended to set up a custom docker network for all of your containers to use, for DNS / network-alias resolution:
```bash
sudo docker network create --subnet 172.20.0.0/16 network20
```

Launch it with the following command to expose TCP ports 12025 for SMTP and 12143 for IMAP on your local network interface.
**_You MUST provide a path volume storage_** (`mkdir /path/to/your/volume/storage`).
```bash
docker run -d --name=protonmail_bridge -v /path/to/your/volume/storage:/root -p 127.0.0.1:12025:25/tcp -p 127.0.0.1:12143:143/tcp --network network20 --restart=unless-stopped ghcr.io/asyncura/proton-mail-bridge:latest
```
**OR** (docker compose version):
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asyncura/ProtonMailBridgeDocker/master/compose.yaml
docker-compose up -d
```

**(Optional)** Make sure the container is running:
```bash
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                          COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                                                  NAMES
d9932fb7136b   ghcr.io/asyncura/proton-mail-bridge:latest   "/app/entrypoint.sh"     About a minute ago   Up About a minute   127.0.0.1:12025->25/tcp, 127.0.0.1:12143->143/tcp   protonmail_bridge
```

**(Optional)** You can check the bridge command line output with, you should see a bridge in ASCII art:
```bash
docker container logs protonmail_bridge
```
**OR** (docker compose version):
```bash
docker-compose logs
```

## Setup

Now, you need to open a bash terminal on the current running container and use the Proton Bridge interactive command line:
```bash
docker exec -it protonmail_bridge /bin/bash
```
**OR** for the Alpine version:
```bash
docker exec -it protonmail_bridge /bin/bash  # If you're using the Alpine tag
```
```
# First we need to kill the default bridge startup instance (only one instance of bridge can run at the same time)
root@8972584f86d4:/app# pkill bridge
# Login to your Proton account:
root@8972584f86d4:/app# /app/bridge --cli
....
      Welcome to Proton Mail Bridge interactive shell
....

# Type help for a list of all commands:

# Tip: Use Ctrl+Shift+V to paste on most Linux terminal.

A sync has finished for test_account.
>>>
# Success !
```

**IF** you are using multiple domain names or email addresses, you **SHOULD** switch to split address mode (it will set credentials for each address in the account).

It will sync the account again, time to grab a coffee.
```
>>> change mode 0
Are you sure you want to change the mode for account test_account to split? yes/no: yes

>>>
```

Use the following information to connect via an SMTP client. The port numbers for the SMTP/IMAP connections are 12025 and 12143 (see command `docker ps`), **NOT** the one provided by the `info`command.

You **_MUST copy the username AND password_** from the info command (the password is random and different from your Proton account):
```
>>> info
Configuration for test_account@proton.me
IMAP Settings
Address:   127.0.0.1
IMAP port: 1143
Username:  test_account@proton.me
Password:  abcedfGHI12345
Security:  STARTTLS

SMTP Settings
Address:   127.0.0.1
SMTP port: 1025
Username:  test_account@proton.me
Password:  abcedfGHI12345
Security:  STARTTLS

Configuration for another_account@proton.me
....

# Exit
>>> exit
root@8972584f86d4:/app# exit
```
See a list of [all Proton bridge commands available here](https://proton.me/support/bridge-cli-guide) or use the `help` command.

We have killed the default bridge instance by exiting it during the previous step, so we **MUST** restart the container:
```bash
docker container restart protonmail_bridge
```
**OR** (docker compose version):
```bash
docker-compose restart
```

**(Optional)** You can check the bridge command line output with:
```bash
docker container logs protonmail_bridge
```
It should end with `A sync has finished for name_of_your_account`

## Notes

1. Your email client might complain about the self-signed certificate used by Proton mail bridge server.
2. If you want other docker containers to only be able to send emails, you should only expose SMTP port 25.

### TrueNAS Scale 24.10 or superior (TrueNAS apps as docker containers)
The docker image was tested on the latest stable version of [TrueNAS Scale](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-scale/) 24.10 (at the time of writing),
 following the [installation custom app screen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/truenasapps/usingcustomapp/) documentation.
You should define a [Dataset](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/24.10/scaleuireference/datasets/) to save your Proton mail data before installing the app.

The recommended parameters are:
1. **Image Configuration** - Image repository: `ghcr.io/asyncura/proton-mail-bridge` / Image tag: `latest` / Pull policy: `Always pull...`
2. **Container Configuration** - Entrypoint: `/app/entrypoint.sh` / Restart Policy: `Unless stopped`
3. **Network Configuration** - Add > Container Port: `25` / Host Port: `12025` (Or any other non-used port) / Protocol: `TCP`
4. **Storage Configuration** - Storage Add > Type: `Host path` / Mount Path: `/root` / Host path: `/mnt/path/to/your/protonmail-dataset` 
5. **Resource Configuration** - `Check` Enable resource limits, configure the limits to your liking.

### TrueNAS Scale 24.04 or inferior (TrueNAS apps as Kubernetes)
The docker image was tested on the latest stable version of [TrueNAS Scale](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-scale/) (at the time of writing),
 following the [installation custom app screen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/scaleuireference/apps/installcustomappscreens/) documentation.

The recommended parameters are:
1. **Container images** - Image repository: `ghcr.io/asyncura/proton-mail-bridge` / Image tag: `latest` / Image pull policy: `Always pull...`
2. **Container Entrypoint** - Command: `/app/entrypoint.sh`
3. **Container Environment Variables** - Add > Environment Variable Name: `PROTON_BRIDGE_SMTP_PORT` / Environment Variable Value: `1026`
4. **Port Forwarding** - Add > Container Port: `25` / Node Port: `12025` (Or any other non-used port) / Protocol: `TCP`
5. **Storage** - Volumes > Mount Path: `/root` / Dataset name: `protonmail` 
6. **Resource limits** - `Check` Enable resource limits, configure the limits to your liking.

About point 3 of the recommended parameters, on Kubernetes (used by TrueNAS Scale for Applications) the Proton Mail Bridge application seems to listening on localhost TCP port 1026 instead of port 1025. To confirm this setting, launch a console on your running Proton Mail bridge pod and see the results of a `netstat -ltpn` command, you are looking for a `bridge` program name on `127.0.0.1:1026`address. 

If everything is set correctly, on a TrueNAS Scale console the following command:
``` bash
sudo k3s kubectl get service --all-namespaces
```
should report the Proton bridge mail as:
```
ix-protonmail-bridge    protonmail-bridge-ix-chart      NodePort    172.17.22.33    <none>  25:12025/TCP        1h
```
The SMTP server is now available from TCP port 12025 on your server's LAN IP address.

## Changelog

## Developers notes

### Automated Builds
This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and push Docker images to both GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) and DockerHub. The workflow:
1. Runs daily at midnight
2. Fetches the latest version of Proton Mail Bridge from the GitHub API
3. Builds both Debian and Alpine Docker images
4. Tags them appropriately:
   - Debian: `latest`, `debian`, `<version>`, `<version>-debian`
   - Alpine: `alpine`, `<version>-alpine`
5. Pushes them to ghcr.io and DockerHub (using GitHub secrets for DockerHub authentication)
6. Updates the README.md files with the new version information

### Manual Builds
For local development and testing, you can use the build.sh script:
```bash
# Build with the latest version from GitHub:
./build.sh

# Build with a specific version:
./build.sh -v v3.19.0
```
